## How to run project

In the project directory, you can run: 'npm start' or 'yarn start' in<br/> 
the terminal to run the project

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />

### Web App Functionality

Home page contains a navigation bar with "Countries API" and "Home" button.<br />

When either of these buttons are clicked they will both return to the home page.<br />

Responsive webpage design for both mobile and desktop.<br />

### Selecting Regions

Countries are filtered and grouped together by the region in which they're located.<br/>

When you click on a region it will take you to anoher webpage that lists and displays<br/>
all the countries in the selected region.<br/>

Web app makes calls to the REST Countries API (https://restcountries.eu) to retrieve<br/>
information about the countries.<br/>

### Missing functionality: Search and Selecting Country to view more information

Due to lack of experience with React, had a difficult time trying to implement the<br/> 
search or modal pop-up view to display more information about the country.
